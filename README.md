The Simon Game is an electronic memory and pattern recognition game where players must replicate a sequence of lights and sounds generated by the game. At the start, the game flashes one color accompanied by a tone. The player must press the matching colored button. With each round, the sequence grows longer by adding a new step, requiring the player to recall and reproduce the complete sequence in the correct order.

The game continues until the player makes a mistake by pressing the wrong button or forgetting the sequence. Difficulty increases as the sequence lengthens, testing memory, concentration, and reaction time.
